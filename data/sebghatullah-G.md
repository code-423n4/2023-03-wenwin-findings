in the following code to prevent gas optimizations you will write like this 

  uint arr=drawIds.lenght;
  ofr

     ticketIds = new uint256[](tickets.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < drawIds.length; ++i) {
            ticketIds[i] = registerTicket(drawIds[i], tickets[i], frontend, referrer);
        }
