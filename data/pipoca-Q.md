## 1. Inappropriate Use of Assert in LotterySetup.sol

The `assert` statement on line 147 checks if the `initialPot` variable is greater than zero. While this check is intended to ensure the initial pot amount is correctly set, using `assert` is not ideal in this case. `Assert` statements are typically used to check for conditions that should never occur, and their use for non-fatal errors may lead to the **Panic error**, which hinders debugging and causes unexpected behavior.

Instead of `assert`, **custom errors** (or `requires`, depending on the situation and design option) should be used to enhance the contract's robustness and facilitate error detection and handling. Custom errors allow for better error messaging, and they do not terminate the contract execution.

## 2. Use of String Instead of Bytes for String Variables in Staking.sol

In Staking.sol, the `string` data type has been used for `name` and `symbol` variables on lines 26 and 27. Using strings for these variables may result in higher gas usage compared to using `bytes`, as strings are dynamic and their size can change during execution. Additionally, using bytes may be more appropriate for certain operations like hashing and encryption.

Regarding the lower limit for bytes, it is generally not recommended to use less than 8 bytes for a variable. Using less than 8 bytes for a variable can cause alignment issues and lead to inefficient memory usage. Therefore, it is important to consider the tradeoff between gas usage and memory usage when deciding on the appropriate data type and size for variables.
